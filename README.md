# ``BbAppRelativeDate``

Relative date formatting and automatic updates.

## Overview

The BbAppRelativeDate library provides utilities for displaying relative timestamps that automatically update over time. It includes ``BbAppRelativeDateTimer`` that manages periodic updates to keep relative dates current (e.g., "2 minutes ago" updates to "3 minutes ago"), and formatting utilities for consistent relative date presentation throughout the application.
